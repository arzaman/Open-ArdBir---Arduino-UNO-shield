# Open-ArdBir---Arduino-UNO-shield
Repository for HW design file (PCB, schematic) of ArdBir shield based on arduino UNO version 


Open Ardbir is an open source SW (up to release 2.8.3) to control and automate beer brewing process The SW have been developed based on Arduino UNO board (Atmega328 MCU) with few surroundings HW component to drive and interface external element (PUMP, Heating element , LCD, push button etc.)

There are few open source HW board available (brauduino) supporting the SW either designed as shield on top of Arduino Board or stand alone board (all in one board). This repository include PCB and SCHEMA for the basic Arduino Uno shield
